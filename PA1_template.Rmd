## Loading and preprocessing the data
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
###Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
activity_total <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = sum)
hist(activity_total$steps, col = "Blue", xlab = "Steps")

###Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean(activity_total$steps)
[1] 10766.19
median(activity_total$steps)
[1] 10765

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
activity_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(activity_interval$interval, activity_interval$steps, type = "l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps")

###Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
x <- max(activity_interval$steps)
subset(activity_interval, activity_interval$steps == x)
    interval    steps
104      835 206.1698

## Imputing missing values
navalues <- subset(activity, is.na(steps))
nrow(navalues)

x <- merge(navalues, activity_interval, by = c("interval"))
y <- x[,c(4,3,1)]
names(y) <- c("steps", "date", "interval")

hist(y$steps, breaks = 20 ,col = "Blue", xlab = "Steps")

mean(y$steps)
[1] 37.3826
median(y$steps)
[1] 34.11321


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

activity_weekdays <- cbind(activity , weekdays(as.Date(activity$date)))
names(activity_weekdays ) <- c("steps", "date", "interval", "weekday")
activity_weekdays  <- cbind(activity_weekdays , ifelse(activity_weekdays $weekday %in% c("sÃ¡bado","domingo"), "Weekend", "Weekday"))
names(activity_weekdays ) <- c("steps", "date", "interval","weekday", "categori")
weekend <- aggregate(steps ~ categori+interval, data=activity_weekdays , FUN=mean)

library(lattice)
xyplot(steps~interval|factor(categori),layout=c(1,2),xlab="Interval",ylab="Steps",type="l",lty=1,data=weekend )
